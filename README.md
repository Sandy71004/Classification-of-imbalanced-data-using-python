# Classification on Imbalanced Data: Insurance Claims Prediction

Predicting the likelihood of insurance claims is crucial for risk assessment and policy pricing in the insurance industry. However, insurance claims datasets often exhibit class imbalance, where non-claims significantly outnumber actual claims. This imbalance can lead to predictive models biased towards the majority class, resulting in poor performance for the minority class, which is often of greater interest.

## Problem Statement

The goal is to predict whether an insurance policy will result in a claim (1) or not (0) using a dataset with imbalanced class distributions. The dataset includes various features related to policy details, vehicle specifications, and policyholder demographics.

## Dataset Features

- `policy_id`: Unique identifier for the insurance policy.
- `subscription_length`: Duration for which the insurance policy is active.
- `customer_age`: Age of the insurance policyholder.
- `vehicle_age`: Age of the insured vehicle.
- `model`: Model of the vehicle.
- `fuel_type`: Type of fuel the vehicle uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel, CNG).
- `max_torque`, `max_power`: Engine performance characteristics.
- `engine_type`: Type of engine.
- `displacement`, `cylinder`: Engine size and construction specifications.
- `region_code`: Code representing the geographical region of the policyholder.
- `region_density`: Population density of the policyholderâ€™s region.
- `airbags`: Number of airbags in the vehicle.
- `is_esc`, `is_adjustable_steering`, `is_tpms`: Safety features like Electronic Stability Control, Adjustable Steering, Tire Pressure Monitoring System.
- `is_parking_sensors`, `is_parking_camera`: Parking aids.
- `rear_brakes_type`: Type of rear brakes.
- `steering_type`, `turning_radius`, `length`, `width`, `gross_weight`: Vehicle specifications.
- Various binary indicators for specific vehicle amenities and safety features.
- `claim_status`: Indicates whether a claim was made (1) or not (0).

## Approach

Handling imbalanced data in classification tasks requires careful consideration of data preprocessing, resampling strategies, model choice, and evaluation metrics. Below is the process followed for this project:

- Begin by analyzing the distribution of classes within your dataset to understand the extent of the imbalance.
- Determine the importance of each class in the context of your specific problem.
- Increase the number of instances in the minority class by replicating them to balance the class distribution.
- Some algorithms, like tree-based methods, are less sensitive to class imbalance. Consider using these or ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosted Trees.
- Besides accuracy, use metrics that are informative for imbalanced datasets, such as Precision, Recall, F1 Score, or the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve.
